what is the challenge faced in traditional way of deploying application in a server?
  In a traditional way of deploying application , we need to install liabraries/ binaries on the top of operating system layer , and then we need to deploy the application , the problem here is when you are 
    deploying two or more application which requires different version of libraries may create conflict and lead to uder utilization of resoures ie, when a server is 64 core but the application running on a
    server requires 3 core per application.but due to different requisit of libraries of diffent application , less application can only be deployed this will lead to server under utilization.
